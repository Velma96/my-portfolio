            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Phoebe Velma Awuor, and I am an economics and mathematics graduate with a passion for uncovering insights through data. Currently, I am honing my technical skills as a software engineering student at Moringa School, where I am exploring the intersection of coding, problem-solving, and data analytics.
                My academic foundation has equipped me with a deep understanding of analytical frameworks and quantitative methods, which I now aim to enhance with advanced programming and machine learning expertise. My ultimate goal is to become a data scientist who leverages data-driven solutions to address complex challenges and drive impactful decision-making.
                Driven by curiosity and a commitment to lifelong learning, I am excited to blend my background in economics with cutting-edge technology to create innovative solutions for tomorrow's problems.
